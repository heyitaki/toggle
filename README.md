S/↓: Quick drop  
D/→: Move piece right  
Mouse: Click and drag to form words 

Tetrament is a combination of the games Tetris and Boggle. 

Control the falling pieces with the WASD or arrow keys. As your pieces fall to the floor, Tetris-style, drag your mouse along the letters of the blocks to form words. You may only move your cursor to adjacent letters, while creating words. 

You can gain points by clearing lines with the Tetris blocks and/or making words (longer words are worth bonus). Note that when you create words, you can only use tiles that have Tetris blocks over them.

Don't let the blocks reach the top of the screen!
