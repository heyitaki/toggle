Tetrament is a combination of the games Tetris and Boggle. 

Control the falling pieces with the WASD or arrow keys. As your pieces fall to the floor, Tetris-style, drag your mouse along the letters of the blocks to form words, Boggle-style. You may only move your cursor to adjacent letters that are also **occupied by a Tetris block**. You can gain points by clearing lines with the Tetris blocks and/or making words (longer words are worth bonus). 

Don't let the blocks reach the top of the screen!
